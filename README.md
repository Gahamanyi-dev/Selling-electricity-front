# Selling Electricity token(FRONTEND)

*User enters amount of money and meter number (accept only 6 digits) then 
the system gives him a token to use. 

*The system should be intelligent enough to validate whether a token is 
valid, used or not known. 

*The token should be only 8 digits (example, token => 02145978). 

*The token generated by the platform gives number of days to have electricity 
in the meter, the policy should be as follows: 100 rwf buys a token that lights 
only 1 day, less than 100rwf is not allowed, half a day token is not allowed, 
but users can pay any multiple of 100 and thus get equivalent days BUT 
should not exceed 5 years (365 days make a year)
